################# EG OF WHAT IT'S USED FOR #################
- Fraud detection
- Web search results
- Real-time ads on web pages
- Credit scoring and next-basis offers
- Prdiction of equipment failures
- New pricing models
- Network intrusion detection
- Recommendation engines
- Customer segmentation
- Text sentiment analysis
- Pattern and image recognition
- Email spam filtering
- Financial modeling


################# MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS #################

                           --------------> Test data ---------------
                          |                                         |
Data aquisition -> Data cleaning -> Model training & building -> Model testing -> Model deployment
                                               |                    |
                                                <-------------------


################# SUPERVISED / UNSUPERVISED LEARNING #################
---------- SUPERVISED ----------
Trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known
e.g a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either 'F' (failed) or 'R' (runs)
Commonly used in applications where historical data predicts the future events
e.g it can attempt to predict the price of a house cased on different features for houses which have historical price data.

---------- UNSUPERVISED ----------
Used against data that has not historical labels
Not told the 'right answer' the algorithm must figure out what it being shown
The goal is to exmplore the data and find some structure within
e.g it can find the main attributes that seperate customer segments from each otherwise
Popular techniques include self-organising maps, nearest-neighbor mapping, k-means clustering and singular value decomposition
One issue: it can be difficult to evaluate results of an unsupervised model!


################# HELPFUL TIPS #################

You need to format the data so that eventually it has 1 or 2 columns:
Like so..
Features, Labels (SUPERVISED)
Features (UNSUPERVISED)

A huge part of MLlib is getting comfortable with the documentation
Being able to master the skill of finding information (NOT memorization) is the key to becoming a great Spark and Python developer.
Use the documentation on the site!!
MLlib Guide!! We will be using this a lot!!
Check out the API section as well!!
